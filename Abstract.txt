Abstract

Fire is an extremely destructive force in the nature that can lead to accidental injuries and 
economical losses, it also can reduce an entire forest or building into ashes. Detection of 
fire at early stages has been a very popular research interest. There are various kinds of fire 
detection algorithms present in current applications. Some of them are based on image 
processing technology and the others are based on neural network technology. As image 
processing may lead to false detection because of randomness in case of feature selection 
we propose convolutional neural network because of its high accuracy recognition rate, 
greater performance in image classification and computer recognition tasks in a wide range 
of applications. In this paper we propose the VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, 
EfficientNet architectures, pretrained versions of the network trained on more than a 
million images from the ImageNet database for fire image classification purpose. Also for 
improving the model accuracy and achieving robustness of the model which is easier and 
more powerful than single algorithm selection, we have applied ensemble method of those 
Pre-trained architectures. Since detection of fire at early stage is very important for 
avoiding hazard we worked on an approach to localize fire at primary stage using an 
advanced CNN architecture and OpenCV which aims to achieve low false alarm rate, high 
detection rate and detection of fire at high speed.
